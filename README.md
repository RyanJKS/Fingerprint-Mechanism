# Fingerprint-Mechanism
A project using JM101 Fingerprint Sensor with STM32 to control an actuator for opening and closing a door.

<br> 
In this project, an STM32 L476RG, JM101 Fingerprint Sensor and some basic wiring was needed.
<br>
Using UART communication, the fingerprint can be controlled in order to: 
<br>
1) Enroll a fingerprint
<br>
2) Scan the fingerprint
<br>
3) Read the amount of fingerprint stored within the sensor
